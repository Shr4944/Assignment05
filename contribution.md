## Contributions
While starting this project, we all decided to go through the dataset and have our opinions on how to use the dataset effectively for our project. 

## Execution
We arranged a meeting for discussing about the project and listed the requirements for the project. 

## Difficulties faced 
We faced difficulties while importing the csv. We were getting lots of errors initially. We decided to convert the csv file to excel and then upload it. Later when we extracted the 1000 records from our dataset, we converted file to csv. iloc was useful to extract 1000 records from the dataset.

## Code of conduct
- We all the had an open discussions for the project.
- We accepted all the opinions 
- Focused on our learning through these tasks
- We were respectful towards each other in every discussion
